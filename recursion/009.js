/*
 * In the game of Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 rods and N disks of different
 * sizes which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts with disks sorted in
 * ascending order of size from top to bottom (each disk sits on top of an even
 * larger disk) with the following constraints.
 * 1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
 * 2. A disk is slid off the top of one rod onto the next rod.
 * 3. A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk.
 *
 * Write a program to move the disks from the first rod to the last.
